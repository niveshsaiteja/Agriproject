      <h1 class="second-section-content-heading">Organic Farming</h1>
      <p class="second-section-para">Organic farming is a sustainable and environmentally-friendly method of agriculture that uses natural inputs and techniques to grow crops and raise livestock. This type of farming promotes soil and water conservation, reduces pollution, and supports biodiversity. <br>
        Organic farmers rely on a variety of practices to maintain the health and fertility of their soil, including crop rotation, cover cropping, and composting. These methods help to build healthy soils that are rich in organic matter and nutrients, and are able to support the growth of healthy plants. <br>
        Organic farmers also avoid the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, instead relying on natural alternatives such as biological control, habitat management, and natural fertilizers like compost and manure. These practices help to reduce the environmental impact of farming, by minimizing pollution and protecting natural ecosystems.

      <p class="second-section-para">Organic farming is a method of agriculture that relies on the use of natural inputs and processes to produce food and other crops.<br>
         It is a sustainable approach to farming that seeks to minimize the use of synthetic chemicals and other harmful inputs that can damage the environment, soil, and crops.Organic farming practices typically include the use of natural fertilizers, such as compost and manure, to improve soil health and promote plant growth. <br>
         Organic farmers may also use natural pest control methods, such as crop rotation, companion planting, and the introduction of beneficial insects, rather than relying on synthetic pesticides.

      <h1 class="second-section-content-heading">Organic Farming</h1>
      <p class="second-section-para">Organic farming also emphasizes the use of renewable resources and the conservation of biodiversity. For example, organic farmers may use cover crops to prevent erosion and improve soil fertility, and they may avoid monoculture, which can lead to the loss of genetic diversity.<br>
        Certification is often required for farmers to label their products as "organic" and to receive premium prices for them. This involves adhering to specific standards and guidelines set by certifying agencies and undergoing periodic inspections to ensure compliance.<br>
        Overall, organic farming is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable approach to agriculture that promotes the health and well-being of both people and the planet.

                  Dry peas, lentils, beans, and chickpeas—known as pulses—are among the world’s most ancient commodities. Archeologists have discovered peas in caves in what is present day Thailand that date back more than 11,000 years. 
                  The royal Egyptian tombs contained lentils, which were meant to sustain the dead on their journey to the afterlife. In the Christian Bible, Esau sold his birthright for a pottage of lentils. And, in Italy, the names for peas (Pisum sp.), 
                  lentils (Lens culinaris), and chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) found their way into the names of the prominent Roman families of Piso, Lentulus, and Cicero.According to Italian writer and academic Umberto Eco, it may even be true that peas, beans, and lentils actually saved Western Civilization
                   During the Early Middle Ages (476 to 1000 AD). It is well documented that the introduction of pulses into crop rotation practices resulted not only in increased farm productivity, but also in improved protein content and a more diverse and nutritional diet for the populace.
                  The development is credited with saving generations of people from malnutrition and helping facilitate the repopulation of Europe after the Black Plague pandemic of the late 1340s.For hundreds of years, the people of northern Italy have enjoyed their own New Year’s tradition called Capo d’Anno (literally “head of the year”) in which lentils.
                   Symbolizing coins, are eaten to ensure good fortune for the year ahead. Consuming these “coins” is thought to make wealth and prosperity part of one’s blood and being. Eating lentils, rather than more exotic or expensive foods, is also considered an act of humility to both heaven and society, and a means for averting the sin of pride.
                   Over time, the United States has seen much of its own rich tradition of eating pulses replaced by a preference for fast food and microwavable meals. Fortunately, Americans are starting to rediscover these overlooked ingredients. Nutritionists have, for example, begun pointing to the pulse rich diets of the Mediterranean as one possible route to improved health.
                    The media, meanwhile, is increasingly touting the benefits of the nutritional attributes and phytochemicals found in pulses. Recent research shows that the antioxidants, flavonoids, plant estrogens, vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber in pulses can help prevent, and may even contribute to, the reversal of many major chronic diseases.
                    Add these health benefits to their delicious flavor and incredible culinary versatility and it is little wonder that Americans are once again finding a place for peas, lentils, and chickpeas in their diets and on their dining room tables. See Appendix C for a collection of sample formulations.

              Dairy products are a rich source of calcium, which is essential for strong bones and teeth. They also provide other nutrients, such as protein, vitamin D, and vitamin B12.
              Some people may have difficulty digesting lactose, a sugar found in milk. This is known as lactose intolerance. However, lactose-free dairy products are available for those who are lactose intolerant.
              Dairy products can be high in saturated fat, which can contribute to heart disease if consumed in excess. Low-fat and fat-free dairy products are available as a healthier alternative.
